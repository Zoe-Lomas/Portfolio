#Project Euler Problem 4 - Largest palindrome made from the product of two 3 digit numbers.
n = 0 #output
for a in range(999, 100, -1): #every 3 digit number
  for b in range(a, 100, -1): #every 3 digit number
        x = a * b #multiply each pair of 3 digit numbers
        if x > n: #if the product is greater than previous products
            s = str(a * b) #convert to string
            if s == s[::-1]: #check it's a palindrome
                n = a * b #replace previous palindrome
print(n)
