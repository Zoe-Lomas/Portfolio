#This program plays FizzBuzz. The object of the game is to count up from 1 but say "Fizz" in place of multiples of 3 and "Buzz" in place of factors of 5 and "FizzBuzz" in place of factors of both 
for i in range(1,100): #counts up from 1
  output=[]
  if i%3==0: #modular to identify multiples of 3
    output.append("Fizz") #adds Fizz to output
  if i%5==0: #modular to identify multiples of 5
    output.append("Buzz") #adds Buzz to output
  if len(output): #checks to see if there's any words to output
    print(output) #if there is it outputs those words
  else: #otherwise it outputs the number
    print(i)
